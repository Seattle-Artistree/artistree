**Version**: 1.0.1 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
Artistree is designed to create a more visual experience for finding new artists based off of your Spotify library. We access their API using OAuth to authenticate the individual user and grab their top artists. A graphical tree is then created from that top artist and its related artists, allowing the user to further explore new music.  Additionally, Artistree utilizes a SQL database to save the user's ID and commentary if they choose to provide feedback.
